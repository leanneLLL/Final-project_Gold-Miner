<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a desktop single-player puzzle game that allows users to perform gold-digging and mining actions. 

It is a recreation of the classic play the "Gold Miner" with new themes, more levels, and more targets to mine.  

The game's goal is to collect gold nuggets and diamonds underground at each level and avoid bombs if you can. 

We used Qt Design Studio to design the user interface prototypes and developed the program in Qt Creator to realize the functionalities.

We re-designed the object generating feature and reward system based on playing time and player movement to provide a standardized, inheritable interface for all current and future character types.

### Built With
The game was developed using C++ and Qt Creator. 
* [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools)
